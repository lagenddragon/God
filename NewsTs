The new update has introduced some important guidelines

Token Generation

Make sure to generate the token 1 hour before booking

During the booking time generate the token again at 40

Internet Usage

Do not use the same network for booking that you used to generate the token

For AC booking, use a separate mobile/network

For SL booking, use a different mobile/network

This will significantly improve your booking success rate

Testing Mode

Testing has been allowed for now so please make use of it

Proxy Usage

The proxy-enabled APK is currently working and will be shifted to Server 2.

You can download it in the morning and start using it.

You may use either a resident proxy or your own custom proxy.

Resident proxy is recommended because it keeps changing your IP continuously, giving better performance.
